I got my MSc degree in 2020 from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, in Brazil. I was part of the [Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering](https://www.ppgee.ufmg.br/index.php). In my research, we investigated the effects of explicit and implicit communications in human-virtual-agent interactions.
