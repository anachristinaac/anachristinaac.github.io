Currently, I'm doing my PhD at University of Manchester under the supervision of Profs. [Bruno Adorno](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Bruno.Adorno/) and [Angelo Cangelosi](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/angelo.cangelosi). My research is on human-robot interaction, specifically decision-making for human-robot communication.
